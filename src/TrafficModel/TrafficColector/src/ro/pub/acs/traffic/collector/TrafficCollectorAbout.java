						"<br/><br/>Traffic Collector is an application that gathers information about daily traffic. The idea is " +
						"to collect data that can be used to construct a model of the traffic patterns in a large city such" +
						" as Bucharest. This means getting data about the traffic on a particular road, depending on the " + 
						"hour of the day or time of the week for example. The model can be used to make predictions about " + 
						"traffic, to construct smart navigation application that might tell you to avoid a certain route " + 
						"because it's always congested at this time of the day. We rely on public crowds (meaning you) to collect the data, and give back freely " + 
						"the obtained data to anyone interesting (everything is public).<br/><br/>" +
